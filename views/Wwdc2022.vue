            After my success in the 2021 Apple WWDC Swift Student Challenge, I decided to participate again in 2022. I decided to participate in the challenge again to further develop my skills and knowledge in Swift programming. I was thrilled to be selected as one of the winners of the challenge and was honored to be recognized by Apple for my work.

            I was quite intrigued by the idea of abstract art and recursion at that time. I wanted to explore the concept of recursion in programming and how it could be used to create unique and interesting art. I decided to create an app that would allow users to explore abstract art using recursion and simple shapes.

            As I was serving National Service during the period of the competition, I began preperation for the challenge during my free time in bunk. I started by researching early 20th-century abstract art and the Supremus art movement. I then began to experiment with SwiftUI and recursion to create the app. I wrote my functions and designs on paper before implementing them in code back at home during the weekends.

            The project I submitted was a mini proof-of-concept and a fun app that could explore early 20th-century abstract art entirely using SwiftUI. Shape views were drawn out recursively through custom recursive functions, resulting in a unique aesthetic. The project aimed to explore an early concept of Supremus, an art movement dedicated to simple shapes. Leveraging recursion, I incorporated programming concepts into the project as well.

            My perseverance paid off, and I was selected as one of the winners of the 2022 Apple WWDC Swift Student Challenge. I was thrilled to be recognized by Apple for my work and was excited to see how my app would be received by the wider community. I was honored to be selected as one of the winners of the challenge and was excited to see how my app would evolve and grow in the future. Apple also invited me to present my development journey at Apple Orchard Store.
